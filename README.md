# HTML Comment Finder

A browser extension designed to locate HTML comments on web pages. Ideal for exploring obscure sites without missing any hidden details.
The extension icon turns red and displays the number of comments found, or green if none are present.

## About this Fork

This version is compatible with Firefox *not chrome!* While I can't vouch for its quality, it is functional.
